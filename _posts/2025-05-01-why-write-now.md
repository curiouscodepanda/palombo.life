# Why Write Now?

I think now more than ever might be one of the best times to start writing and sharing ideas. With the introduction of artificial intelligence to the world, we’ve seen a massive influx of AI generated content. With current model intelligence, this has lead to a state of more noise and less signal online. This is aided by social media, where algorithms are hyper-optimized for engagement and time on platform, usually leading to less nuance and quality, and thus more outrage and tribalism. But there’s variety of reasons why I think it’s important to start writing right now:

### 0. Flushing out Ideas & Nuances
(yes starting at 0 -> embracing that computer science mindset)  
  
Zooming out a bit, we live on a massive rock, in a massive solar system, in a massive galaxy, in a massive universe. It can be humbling to think that humans have the unique ability to easily write and produce novel thought in such an environment, but we do. Writing is important for me because it provides the opportunity to capture, improve, and flush out novel thought and expand upon it. Sometimes I feel like I have an idea in my head and I’m not always able to articulate it into the right words. I’d like to change that. It also allows the opportunity for research to verify or counter such thoughts, and to explore nuance & specifics that isn’t really translatable to spoken word (for me, at least). 

### 1. Thought Vault 

Writing provides a method to archive thoughts, reflect on them, and hopefully getting closer to truth and objectivity. It allows for idea iteration as new information becomes available. It opens the door to scientific thinking, experiments with various hypothesis that ultimately allow should allow me to narrow in on stronger ideas.

### 2. Learning & Practice

The goal of this blog is ultimately to learn and practice through experience. The idea here is that hopefully when I look back in a few years, this will be the worst post I’ve ever written. By iteratively developing my writing skills and deliberately practicing, I’ll hopefully not only be a better writer, but also a better human and a better version of myself.

### 3. Logging my journey & thinking through life

Touching on the points above, I think it’ll be fun to look back in a few years and reflect on where my thinking was at during this time in my life. Will it vary greatly vs. where I am in the future? What blindspots am I missing now that future me will be kicking myself about? What will future me be thanking myself for? How will what I learn in the future change my perspective of past posts? These are all the sorts of questions I’ll be so curious to run through as I revisit these posts down the line.

### Closing

Hopefully this was at least somewhat of an interesting read, and perhaps inspires other to do what I’ve been putting off so long, and that’s write, now. 

### After thought

As an afterthought after writing this, I realized the benefits of writing in the coming years are going to be amplified significantly as artificial intelligent scales and improves. If you’re able to write better, naturally you’ll be able to command models better. You’ll also be able to feed it your past writing and have an on-demand thought critique, which will be an incredible way to understand your biases and uncover your blindspots. There really is no better time to start writing
